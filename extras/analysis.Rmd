## Testing behaviors measured

**Balance of effort on test-writing and solution-writing**:

* Project coevolution (`pc`) -- Percent of overall code in each work session that is test code
* Method coevolution (`mc`) -- Percent of method-specific code in each work session that is test code *for that method*

**Sequence or order of test-code and solution-code writing**:

* Average recency (`t.rec`) -- For each method's timeline, approximately when were changes made to relevant test code?
* Line recency (`l.rec`) -- If all changes related to a method are placed in a line, where in that sequence to changes to relevant test code fall?
* How much work was done between defining a method and writing the first test code for the method? In terms of code additions: (`tc`)
* How much work was done between defining a method and writing the first test code for the method? In terms of time: (`tc.time`)

## Analysis

**Model information**

* Models are *linear mixed-effects models* -- assignments are repeated measures over subjects (students).
* Used backward stepwise selection to select the best model.

**Outcome measures**

* External quality (correctness)
* Internal quality (code coverage)

#### External quality (correctness)

**Model estimates**

```{r include=FALSE}
m.correctness = step(lmer(score.reftest ~ mc + tc + pc + l.rec + t.rec + tc.time + (1 | userName), 
                              data = p124, REML = F), reduce.random = F)$model
r1 = r2.corr.mer(m.correctness) * 100
s1 = summary(m.correctness)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
s1$coefficients
```

Significant contributors are *overall balance of test and solution code* (`mc`), *average line recency* (`l.rec`), and *average time recency* (`t.rec`).

These three measures explain `r round(r1, digits = 2)`% of the variance in external quality.

I can't really explain the existence of results 2 and 3. I would need to think about it some more.

#### Internal quality (code coverage)

**Model estimates**

```{r include=FALSE}
m.coverage = step(lmer(elementsCovered ~ mc + tc + pc + l.rec + t.rec + tc.time + (1 | userName), 
                              data = p124, REML = F), reduce.random = F)$model
r2 = r2.corr.mer(m.coverage) * 100
s2 = summary(m.coverage)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
s2$coefficients
```

Only significant contributor is *overall balance of test and solution code* (`pc`).

This measure explains `r round(r2, digits = 2)`% of the variance in internal quality.

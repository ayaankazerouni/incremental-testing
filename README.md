# sensordata-mining

Repo for work done on part of my PhD research and CS 5704 Software Engineering project.

Mining software repositories from student code to assess incremental development and testing practices.

Thanks to [mauricioaniche](https://github.com/mauricioaniche/) for his work on [RepoDriller](https://github.com/mauricioaniche/repodriller).

# Measuring incremental testing

Repo for work done on part of my PhD research and CS 5704 Software Engineering project.

Mining software repositories from student code to assess incremental development and testing practices.

Thanks to [mauricioaniche](https://github.com/mauricioaniche/) for his work on [RepoDriller](https://github.com/mauricioaniche/repodriller).
This work depends on a particular branch from my fork of RepoDriller on GitHub: [ayaankazerouni/repodriller:sigcse-2019](https://github.com/ayaankazerouni/repodriller/tree/sigcse-2019) (see [mauricioaniche/repodriller#128](https://github.com/mauricioaniche/repodriller/issues/128)).

This work will soon be published:
* Ayaan M. Kazerouni, Clifford A. Shaffer, Stephen H. Edwards, Francisco Servant. *Measuring Incremental Testing and Its Impact on Project Outcomes*. SIGCSE Technical Symposium. 2019.
